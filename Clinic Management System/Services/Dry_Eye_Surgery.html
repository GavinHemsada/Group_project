                            <h4 class="card-title">What is dry eye?</h4>
                            <p class="card-text1"> Dry eye is a condition where your eyes don’t produce enough tears, or the quality of your tears is poor, causing the eyes to dry out. Tears are essential for maintaining healthy eyes, as they keep the surface lubricated, clear, and comfortable. When the tear production is insufficient or imbalanced, it leads to irritation, inflammation, and discomfort.</p>
                            <h4 class="card-title">What are the common causes of dry eye?</h4>

                             <h6 class="card-text2"> Dry eye can be caused by various factors, including:</h6>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Aging: Tear production naturally decreases with age, making dry eye more common in older adults.</li>
                         <li>Environmental factors: Wind, smoke, dry air, or prolonged exposure to air conditioning can cause tears to evaporate more quickly.</li>
                         <li>Extended screen use: Staring at screens for long periods reduces blinking, which leads to faster tear evaporation.</li>
                         <li>Medications: Certain medications like antihistamines, antidepressants, and blood pressure drugs can decrease tear production.</li>
                         <li>Health conditions: Autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjögren’s syndrome), diabetes, or thyroid problems can cause dry eye.</li>
                          <li>Hormonal changes: Changes in hormone levels, especially in women during pregnancy, menopause, or while using contraceptives, can reduce tear production.</li>
                       </ul>
                        </div>
                   </div>

                    <h4 class="card-title">What are the symptoms of dry eye?</h4>
                     <h6 class="card-text2">Symptoms of dry eye include:</h6>
                       <ul>
                         <li>A stinging or burning sensation in the eyes.</li>
                         <li>Eye redness</li>
                         <li>Sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>
                         <li>Blurred vision or difficulty focusing</li>
                         <li>A gritty feeling, as if something is in your eye</li>
                         <li>Excessive tearing as a response to irritation</li>
                         <li>Eye fatigue after reading or working on a screen</li>
                       </ul>

                    <h4 class="card-title">How can you protect your eyes from dry eye?</h4>
                     <h6 class="card-text2">You can protect your eyes from dry eye by making simple lifestyle adjustments:</h6>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Increase humidity: Use a humidifier indoors to add moisture to the air, especially in dry or air-conditioned environments.</li>
                         <li>Take breaks from screens: Follow the 20-20-20 rule—every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds.</li>
                         <li>Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to support tear production.</li>
                         <li>Use artificial tears: Over-the-counter lubricating eye drops can help keep your eyes moist.</li>
                         <li>Wear protective eyewear: In windy or dry conditions, wearing wraparound sunglasses can help protect your eyes from the elements.</li>
                         <li>Reduce exposure to smoke and irritants: Avoid smoking or being around secondhand smoke, as it can worsen dry eye symptoms.</li>    
                       </ul>  

                    <h4 class="card-title"> How does Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic treat dry eye?</h4>
                     <h6 class="card-text2">Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic offers a variety of treatments for dry eye, depending on the severity and cause of the condition:</h6>
                       <ul>
                         <li>Artificial tears: For mild cases, over-the-counter lubricating eye drops can provide temporary relief.</li>
                         <li>Prescription eye drops: For more severe cases, prescription drops like anti-inflammatory medications may be recommended to reduce inflammation and improve tear production.</li>
                         <li>Punctal plugs: These are tiny devices inserted into the tear ducts to block drainage and help tears stay on the eye’s surface longer.</li>
                         <li>Lifestyle advice: The clinic provides guidance on avoiding irritants, improving tear production, and modifying your environment to reduce dryness.</li>
                       </ul>     
                    <h4 class="card-title">Can dry eye become a chronic condition?</h4>
                    <p class="card-text2">Yes, dry eye can become a chronic condition, particularly if it is caused by factors such as aging, autoimmune diseases, or long-term exposure to environmental triggers. Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic offers ongoing care to help manage chronic dry eye with regular check-ups, personalized treatment plans, and continuous support to ensure long-term relief.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Can untreated dry eye lead to complications?</h4>
                    <p class="card-text2">Yes, if left untreated, dry eye can lead to more serious complications. Prolonged dryness can cause damage to the cornea (the eye's surface), increase the risk of eye infections, and in severe cases, result in ulcers or scarring. Managing dry eye early can prevent these issues and maintain healthy vision.</p>
