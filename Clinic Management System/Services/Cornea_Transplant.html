                    <p class="card-text1">At Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic, we specialize in corneal transplants a surgical procedure that replaces your damaged or diseased cornea, the transparent front layer of your eye. Also known as corneal grafting or keratoplasty, this procedure helps restore clear vision by replacing the impaired cornea with healthy donor tissue.</p>

                     <p class="card-text" >Your eye care provider may recommend you consider a cornea transplant if you’ve damaged your cornea. Cornea damage causes eye pain, cloudy and blurred vision.
                     Our expert surgeons may recommend a corneal transplant if you experience eye pain, blurred vision, or cloudiness due to cornea damage. This condition can arise from infections, injuries, or degenerative diseases. At Eagle Vision, our goal is not just to restore your vision but to enhance your overall quality of life.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">Are there different types of cornea transplant surgeries?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text3">There are three surgical options for cornea transplant: penetrating keratoplasty, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and endothelial keratoplasty. Your cornea has three layers of tissue. Each of these surgeries targets a specific layer or layers of tissue.All corneal transplants use corneas from deceased human organ donors. Every donor cornea undergoes thorough testing to make sure it’s safe for transplant.</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                            <li><h6>Penetrating keratoplasty</h6></li>
                            <p class="card-text4">Another term for penetrating keratoplasty is full-thickness cornea transplantation. Developed over 100 years ago, the modern version of this surgery continues to help thousands of people each year. In this procedure, your surgeon uses a small circular blade to remove the entire center part of the damaged cornea and replaces it with a healthy, same-shaped piece of donor cornea.</p>
                            <li><h6>Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty</h6></li>
                            <p class="card-text3">If the innermost layer of your cornea is healthy and the damage lies in the middle and outer layers, your surgeon may perform a partial thickness cornea transplant. Another term for this is a deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. During this surgery, your surgeon removes the middle and outer layers of your cornea and replaces them with healthy donated corneal tissue.</p>
                            <li><h6>Endothelial keratoplasty</h6></li>
                            <p class="card-text3">This surgery may help if you have damage on the innermost layer of your cornea, the endothelium, which rests on Descemet’s membrane. Surgeons perform two types of endothelial keratoplasty surgeries:

                            <ul>
                            <li>Descemet’s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK).</li>
                                <li>Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK).</li>
                            </ul>
                                Both surgeries involve removing damaged endothelial tissue and replacing it with healthy donor tissue. The difference between DSAEK and DMEK is the thickness of the donor cornea-DSAEK is thicker, while DMEK is thinner. You and your surgeon will decide which type of transplant is best for your specific eye condition.

                                Endothelial keratoplasty procedures require fewer sutures than other keratoplasty procedures. Instead, the technique uses an air bubble to keep the donor cornea in position. To increase the chance of success, you’ll need to make sure you’re lying face up when you rest or sleep for the first few days after surgery. Lying face up helps the air bubble keep your transplanted corneal tissue in place.</p>

                    <h3 class="card-title">How should I prepare for a cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">The Eagle vision eye care surgeon and anesthesia team will review your medical history, answer your questions, and confirm the surgical plan.  They will let you know if you need to stop taking certain medications or over-the-counter (OTC) products before your surgery.  They will tell you when to stop eating and drinking before surgery.  You will not be able to drive and will need transportation home after the surgery. Even after the surgery, eagle care will provide you with the services and advice you need.</p>
                    <h3 class="card-title">What happens during a cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">The anesthesia team will administer either sedation or general anesthesia (making you unconscious), depending on your medical condition and what you and your healthcare provider have discussed. A caregiver will apply numbing medication to your eye.</p>
                    <h3 class="card-title">How long is cornea transplant surgery?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">The surgery typically takes less than two hours to perform.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-title">What happens during a cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">After your cornea transplant, you’ll need someone to drive you home and might want someone to stay with you that evening. You’ll leave with an eye patch, which you must wear as your doctor instructs. Your eye may be red, sore, and sensitive to light for a few days, but you can manage the pain with over-the-counter medicine.If you had an endothelial transplant, you’ll need to lie on your back for a few days. Avoid activities that could hurt your eye. You’ll have a follow-up appointment in 24-48 hours to check how your eye is healing.</p>

                    <p>You’ll also get eye drops or ointments to help your eye heal and prevent infection. Depending on your surgery, you might need to have stitches removed later. Your doctor may recommend wearing protective glasses, and it’s important not to rub or press on your eye. If you have any problems, contact your doctor right away.</p>
                        <h3 class="card-title">What are the benefits of a cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">Most people who have a cornea transplant see more clearly. In rare circumstances, you may have a cornea transplant to reduce eye pain.A cornea transplant is generally a very safe surgery. Eagle vision care our surgical team will make every effort to reduce your risk of complications.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title">What is the recovery outlook after a cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">The success of a cornea transplant depends on factors like the cause of cornea damage, the surgical technique, the surgeon’s skill, and how well your body accepts the donor tissue. Blurred vision after surgery is common, but it improves over time. Full vision recovery can take up to 12 months for a full-thickness transplant and around three months for an endothelial transplant.</p>

                    <p>You won’t be able to drive on the day of surgery, and someone should drive you home. If your other eye has good vision, you may drive after 24 hours, but your surgeon may recommend waiting longer, especially for an endothelial transplant.Returning to work depends on your recovery. You may go back in a few days or weeks, depending on your discomfort and job type. If your job is physically demanding, you may need more time off.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title">Will I need to wear glasses or contacts after cornea transplant?</h3>
                    <p class="card-text2">After your cornea transplant at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic, you may need to wear glasses or contact lenses to improve your vision. In cases of full-thickness cornea transplants, the cornea may heal with an irregular surface, causing astigmatism (distorted vision). In these situations, corrective lenses or even additional surgery may be required to help restore clear vision.For those who have undergone endothelial transplants, specialized contact lenses like rigid gas permeable or scleral lenses are generally not needed. However, after surgeries like penetrating keratoplasty or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty, these lenses might be recommended. Our skilled surgeons will work closely with you to explore the best vision correction options tailored to your specific needs, ensuring optimal post-surgery care.</p>
