                            <h4 class="card-title">What is Retina Repair surgery?</h4>
                            <p class="card-text1">Retina Repair surgery at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic is a specialized procedure designed to treat a range of retinal conditions that can cause vision loss or impairment. The retina, located at the back of the eye, plays a crucial role in vision by converting light into signals sent to the brain. Damage to the retina from conditions like retinal detachment, tears, or macular degeneration can lead to severe vision issues. Retina Repair surgery aims to restore or preserve vision by addressing these issues through advanced surgical techniques. </p>
                            <p>Our highly skilled team, with over a decade of experience, performs procedures like vitrectomy, laser photocoagulation, or scleral buckling, depending on the specific condition. Using state-of-the-art equipment, we ensure precise, effective treatment tailored to each patient’s needs. Our goal is not only to repair the retina but to improve the quality of life by protecting your vision for the long term.</p>
