                            <h4 class="card-title">What is a vision check?</h4>
                            <p class="card-text1">A vision check at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic involves a comprehensive eye exam to assess your overall eye health and vision quality. It includes tests to check for visual acuity, refractive errors (like nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism), and other eye conditions such as glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. </p>
                            <h4 class="card-title">How often should I get a vision check?</h4>

                             <p class="card-text" >It’s recommended to have a vision check every 1 to 2 years, depending on your age and overall eye health. For adults over 40, more frequent exams may be necessary, especially if you're at risk for conditions like glaucoma or cataracts. Children should have their first eye exam at six months, then at three years, and before starting school.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">What tests are included in a vision check?</h4>
                        <h6 class="card-text2">During a vision check, we conduct several tests, including:</h6>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Visual Acuity Test: Measures the sharpness of your vision using an eye chart.</li>
                            <li>Refraction Test: Determines your prescription for glasses or contact lenses.</li>
                            <li>Tonometry: Measures the pressure inside your eye to check for glaucoma.</li>
                            <li>Slit-Lamp Examination: Allows your doctor to see the front part of your eye, including the cornea, lens, and iris.</li>
                            <li>Retinal Exam: Evaluates the back of your eye to check for signs of damage or disease.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4 class="card-title">Can I check my vision at home?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">While you can perform basic vision tests at home using online tools or vision charts, these are not a substitute for a professional exam. A comprehensive vision check at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic includes detailed evaluations that can catch early signs of eye diseases that home tests cannot detect.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Why is it important to have regular vision checks?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">Regular vision checks help detect vision problems early, even before symptoms appear. Early detection of conditions like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts can prevent vision loss. Additionally, your prescription for glasses or contacts may change over time, and regular exams ensure you're seeing as clearly as possible.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">What should I bring to my vision check appointment?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">When coming to your appointment at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic, bring your current glasses or contact lenses, a list of any medications you’re taking, and any relevant medical history related to your eyes. If you’ve experienced changes in your vision or have specific concerns, it’s important to inform your doctor.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">What happens if my vision has changed?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">If the tests show that your vision has changed, your eye care provider will recommend corrective options such as glasses, contact lenses, or in some cases, surgery like LASIK. At Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic, we work with you to find the best solution for your lifestyle and eye health.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">What is the difference between a vision check and a comprehensive eye exam?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">A vision check focuses primarily on assessing your eyesight and determining if you need glasses or contacts. A comprehensive eye exam, on the other hand, not only checks your vision but also looks for signs of eye diseases and overall eye health issues.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">Can a vision check detect eye diseases?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">Yes, during a vision check, we can detect early signs of eye diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or cataracts. If anything unusual is found, further testing or treatment will be recommended.</p>

                            <h4 class="card-title">How can I prepare for a vision check at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic?</h4>
                        <p class="card-text2">To prepare for your vision check, avoid eye strain before your appointment, especially if you wear contact lenses or work on screens for long hours. If you’re getting your eyes dilated, consider arranging transportation home, as dilation may temporarily affect your vision.</p>
