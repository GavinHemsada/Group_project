                        <p class="card-text" > Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic uses routine eye exams as the foundation for monitoring and maintaining patients' eye health. These exams not only evaluate a patient's vision but also screen for early signs of potential eye conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration. The clinic uses these checkups to track any subtle changes in vision over time and detect issues before they become more serious. This proactive approach ensures that patients receive the necessary interventions at the earliest stages, preventing complications and maintaining good vision.</p>

                    <h4 class="card-title">Why are routine eye exams important at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic?</h4>

                    <p class="card-text2">During routine eye exams at Eagle Vision Eye Care Clinic, the doctors check for a wide variety of common eye conditions. These include cataracts, which cause clouding of the lens and can lead to vision impairment if untreated; glaucoma, a condition that damages the optic nerve and can cause permanent vision loss; and macular degeneration, which affects the central part of the retina and is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. In addition to these conditions, the clinic checks for signs of diabetic retinopathy and other vision-related issues that may arise due to age, lifestyle, or underlying health conditions.</p>
